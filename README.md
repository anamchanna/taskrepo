* Task 2: Add a timer to the code editor

This repo contains the source code to the front end of the first
task. It contains a code editor and a way to submit code for
evaluation. It does not contain a way to show how long the task has
been taking.

Your task is to add a timer to it.

An automated process will evaluate whether this task has been done
successfully. In particular, it will be looking for:

- Editor and output elements to be hidden.

- A timer element with the id of #timer that initially contains
  `00:00:00` (minutes, seconds, and hundredths of seconds).

- A button named `start` that can be clicked to make the editor and
  output elements visible and start the timer.

- The timer to run after the start button is clicked.

- A good code submission (for which the sever reports "Success!") to
  stop the timer and display the final time value.

Make the changes you feel are necessary to this repo and push it back
to the upstream to start the evaluation process. You may do this as
many times as you wish until the evaluator announces success.
